# SIWF Embedded Wallet SDK

![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40projectlibertylabs%2Fsiwf-embedded-wallet-sdk)
## Overview

This SDK handles:

* Signing and submitting SIWF payloads (e.g., add provider, claim handle, add graph key)
* Creating or logging into decentralized identities (MSAs) on Frequency
* Calling back to your app after MSA creation via a custom callback
* Integrating with existing wallet signature flows

It’s ideal for Web3 applications that want to support **embedded wallet** experiences where the wallet is controlled programmatically.

---

## Installation

Recommended Node version is **v22.16.0**.
```bash
npm install @projectlibertylabs/siwf-embedded-wallet-sdk
```

---

## Quick Start
```ts
import { startSiwf } from "@projectlibertylabs/siwf-embedded-wallet-sdk";

const startSiwfResponse = await startSiwf(
  userAddress,
  signatureFn,
  gatewayFetchFn,
  siwfSignedRequest,
  userHandle,
  email,
  msaCreationCallback,
);
```

## Function Details

### Signature Function

This function connects your embedded wallet to the SIWF interface. It follows the same interface as the [`window.ethereum.request`](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/reference/provider-api/#request) method, although is reduced in scope.

There are only two methods requested: `eth_signTypedData_v4` for [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) signature requests and `personal_sign` for [CAIP-122](https://chainagnostic.org/CAIPs/caip-122) Sign In with X standard.

#### TypeScript Types
```ts
type SignatureFn = (request: WindowEthereumRequest) => Promise<string>;
```

---

### Gateway Fetch Function

This function connects the SDK to your instance of [Frequency Gateway Account Service](https://projectlibertylabs.github.io/gateway/Build/AccountService/AccountService.html).
Remember that Account Service is NOT a public facing service, so MUST be securely proxied.
This function will only call two endpoints, but you must map those endpoints to your own endpoints.

#### Endpoints Called
- [POST: /v2/accounts/siwf](https://projectlibertylabs.github.io/gateway/account/#tag/v2accounts/operation/AccountsControllerV2_postSignInWithFrequency) using the `authorizationPayload` version
- [GET: /v1/accounts/account/{UserControlKey}](https://projectlibertylabs.github.io/gateway/account/#tag/v1accounts/operation/AccountsControllerV1_getAccountForAccountId) to fetch account details

#### TypeScript Types

```ts
type Address = string;

type GatewayFetchFn = (
  method: "GET" | "POST",
  path: `/v1/accounts/account/${Address}` | "/v2/accounts/siwf",
  body?: undefined | { authorizationPayload: string; },
) => Promise<Response>;
```

---

### MSA Callback Function

When a new user signs up, the allocation of the MSA Id on-chain can take some time. This callback will be called once the allocation is completed, or if the user already has an account, it will return the value without waiting.

```ts
interface AccountResponse {
  msaId: string;
  handle?: {
    base_handle: string;
    canonical_base: string;
    suffix: number;
  };
}

type MsaCreationCallbackFn = (account: AccountResponse) => void;
```

---

## How It Works

1. Checks if the user has an existing MSA.
2. If not:

   * Validates provided `email` and `handle`
   * Signs required payloads (provider, graph key, handle)
   * Submits to the Gateway
   * Calls the `msaCreationCallback` after async MSA allocation
3. If the user does have an MSA:

   * Signs a login payload
   * Submits to the Gateway
4. In both cases, returns the Ethereum-compatible response.

---

## Development Scripts

* `npm run build` – Build all outputs (ESM + CJS + types)
* `npm run format` – Typecheck, format, and lint
* `npm run clean` – Clean the `dist` folder

---

## Testing

Tests are written using **Vitest**.

To run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

- DOES call the `SignatureFn` and `GatewayFetchFn` with the correct parameters.
- DOES NOT use the responses from either the `SignatureFn` or the `GatewayFetchFn`.
- Uses requests that _may NOT validate_ for `GatewayFetchFn` due to the static nature, but they do have the correct structure.
- Responses are _static_.
- DOES NOT currently return the Recovery Secret or the original credential values
